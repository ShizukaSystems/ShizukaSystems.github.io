            <p>In order to improve our ShizukaSystems Services and provide more convenient, relevant experiences to our customers, we and our agents may use “cookies,” “web beacons,” and similar devices to track your activities. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card and enables us to record your passwords and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. A web beacon is a small transparent .gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, and most services that include similar devices are typically initially activated to collect data. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. We do not support browsers’ Do Not Track features. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the preferences or settings page of your browser. If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality of using our Site, as cookies may be necessary to track and enhance your use and access.</p>
            <p>We may, either directly or indirectly, track your behavior on our Site, ShizukaSystems Products, or ShizukaSystems Services for purposes of our own customer support, analytics, research, product development, fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, as well as to enable you to use and access the Site, ShizukaSystems Products, or ShizukaSystems Services and pay for your activities on the Site, ShizukaSystems Products, or ShizukaSystems Services. We may also, either directly or through third parties we engage to provide services to us, track your behavior on our Site, ShizukaSystems Products, or ShizukaSystems Services.</p>
            <h2>7. Protecting Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use a variety of security measures, including SSL, encryption, and authentication tools, to help protect your information. We do not retain your Personal Information for longer than is necessary for our business purposes. When we no longer need your Personal Information, we dispose of it safely.</p>
            <p>Our security measures include standard international data protection measures as well as those described in the EU GDPR implementing regulations. These measures, may also include periodic system-wide password resets with high password strength requirements. We strongly discourage password sharing. Due to the nature of the information and related technology, we cannot be held responsible if you share your own login credentials with others. If we learn of a security breach, then we will immediately reset your account password and attempt to notify you as per GDPR guidelines to take appropriate steps.</p>
            <h2>8. Data Processing</h2>
            <p>In submitting any third-party personal data within the context of the ShizukaSystems Services (“Third-Party Data”), the parties agree that you shall be the Data Controller and you appoint us as a Data Processor of such data, for the purpose of providing the ShizukaSystems Services.

            <ul>
                <li>Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard the Third-Party Data against any unauthorized or unlawful access, loss, destruction, theft, use or disclosure. We implement basic level security in accordance with Russian Federation law. If higher levels of security are required, please contact us.</li>

                <li>Only process the personal data as specified by this Privacy Policy and in accordance with your instructions, and will not use the Third-Party Data for any purposes other than those related to the performance of the ShizukaSystems Services or pursuant to your written instructions.</li>
                <li>Upon the expiry or termination of this Privacy Policy, or upon your request, cease any and all use of the Third-Party Data and destroy or return it to you.</li>

            </ul>
            <p>We as Data Processor may provide access to a subcontractor processor to any such Third-Party Data if we reasonably consider such access and processing necessary to the performance of the Services. In the event of such access and before the access takes place, we will ensure that an agreement with the third-party is in place which is sufficient to require it to treat personal data in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Privacy Policy and applicable law. In particular, you authorize us to subcontract the provision of technology and commercial services to members of our corporate group.</p>
            <p>You represent and warrant that you have all the appropriate consents from data subjects whose personal data are submitted to us in the course of the provision of the Services. </p>
